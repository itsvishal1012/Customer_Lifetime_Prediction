## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Excel (for initial analysis or reports)

---

## 📈 Key Features & Insights

- **Descriptive statistics:** via `.describe()` and visualizations
- **Correlation analysis** via heatmap
- **Advanced insights:**
  - High-value vs low-value segments
  - RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scoring
  - Revenue contribution by customer segments
- **Predictive model** to forecast CLV using:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
